# ycast should listen on an IP address that is provided by dnsmasq (from name ycast).
#	It should be different from the addresses where e.g. nginx listens for port 80 (so no 'listen 80' in nginx.conf, but 192.168.4.1:80)
#	no other server should be listening on this IP address & port 80
#	I do this because simply using proxy_pass in nginx doesn't work. It looks like Yamaha doesn't like the proxied reply
#	check /etc/dnsmasq.d for the matching configuration
